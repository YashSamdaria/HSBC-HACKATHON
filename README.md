# AI-Powered Fraud Detection System Documentation

## 1. Overview
This system detects fraudulent financial transactions in **real-time** using a **hybrid machine learning pipeline** that combines:
- Unsupervised anomaly detection,
- Generative oversampling via GAN,
- Supervised classification.

**Key goals**: High precision and recall, robustness, scalability, and low-latency inference.

## 2. Pipeline Architecture

### 2.1 Data Preprocessing
- **Categorical Encoding**: Encoded via `LabelEncoder` (e.g., customer ID, age group, gender).
- **Standardization**: Continuous features standardized using `StandardScaler`.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA applied to retain core variance while reducing dimensionality.

### 2.2 Models Used

#### 2.2.1 GAN + MLP
- **Purpose**: Mitigate class imbalance by generating synthetic fraud samples.
- **Components**:
  - Lightweight **GAN** (Dense-layer Generator and Discriminator).
  - **MLP Classifier** trained on real + GAN-generated data.
- **Features**:
  - Adaptive thresholding via `precision_recall_curve`.
  - Threshold optimized for **maximum F1 score** (balance between precision & recall).

#### 2.2.2 Isolation Forest + XGBoost (Improved)
- **Isolation Forest**: Unsupervised anomaly detection on normal (non-fraud) transactions.
- **XGBoost**:
  - Supervised classifier using real transactions.
  - Incorporates **anomaly scores** as a feature.
- **Key Features**:
  - Uses `scale_pos_weight` for imbalance handling.
  - Isolation score boosts subtle fraud detection.

#### 2.2.3 Ensemble
- **Weighted Output**:
  - 70%: GAN+MLP probability.
  - 30%: Isolation Forest + XGBoost.
- **Goal**: Balance generalization (GAN) with anomaly specificity (IF).

## 3. Evaluation Metrics
- **Precision**: % of flagged frauds that are true frauds.
- **Recall**: % of all frauds correctly flagged.
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix**: TP, FP, FN, TN distribution.
- **AUC-ROC**: Area under ROC curve—discriminative power across thresholds.

## 4. Feature Engineering & Insights

### 4.1 Feature Selection
- PCA reduces noise/sparsity.
- Isolation Forest's **anomaly score** appended to feature vector for XGBoost.
- GAN trained solely on **minority (fraud)** distribution.

### 4.2 Data Insights
- Fraud clusters observed in lower-dimensional PCA projections.
- Encoded merchant categories show subtle fraud deviations.
- Specific zip code + merchant category combos correlate with fraud.

## 5. System Properties

### 5.1 Innovation
- **GAN-based Oversampling**: Replaces SMOTE/naive resampling with realistic synthetic fraud.
- **Hybrid Ensemble**: Combines generative and anomaly-driven modeling.
- **Threshold Calibration**: Dynamic tuning (not default 0.5) via PR curve optimization.

### 5.2 Real-Time Readiness
- **Inference latency**:
  - MLP/XGBoost: < 20ms.
  - GAN: Training-only (offline).
- **Exportability**:
  - Use `joblib`, `ONNX`, or `SavedModel` for deployment.
  - Supports lightweight inference APIs.

### 5.3 Efficiency
- PCA reduces input dimensionality → faster training + inference.
- All models are compact and suitable for CPU or edge devices.
- Isolation Forest is trained only on normal class → faster fit + scoring.

## 6. Explainability
- **XGBoost**:
  - Feature importances easily visualized.
  - Highlights impact of Isolation scores.
- **MLP**:
  - Output confidence can be interpreted using **SHAP** (if integrated).
- **Isolation Forest**:
  - Anomaly score gives intuitive sense of "deviation" from norm.

---

## 7. Robustness
- **GAN**: Covers rare fraud patterns → improves generalization.
- **IF + XGBoost**: Handles unseen fraud via anomaly detection.
- **Ensemble**: Reduces overfitting risk and improves resilience to adversarial inputs.

---

## 8. Deployment Plan

### Training (Offline)
- GAN training on fraud class.
- Isolation Forest fit on normal transactions.
- Final training of MLP and XGBoost with augmented features.

### Inference Stack

### Deployment Options
- **REST API** (FastAPI / Flask).
- Deployable on modest CPU or edge devices.

---

## 9. Extensibility
- New features like **velocity metrics**, **user history vectors** can be added.
- GAN module can scale to deeper GANs or be replaced with **VAE**.
- Pipeline is modular → plug into streaming platforms like **Kafka** or **Spark Streaming**.

This system delivers a **production-grade fraud detection pipeline** with:
- **High Recall + Precision**
- **Real-Time Inference**
- **Explainable Decisions**
- **Adversarial Robustness**
